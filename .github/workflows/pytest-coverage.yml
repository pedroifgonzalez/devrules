# GitHub Actions workflow to run pytest with coverage and fail if coverage < 90%
# Notes:
# - This runs on pushes and PRs targeting `develop` and `main`.
# - To block merges to `develop` and `main` when this check fails,
#   add branch protection rules in your repository settings that require
#   this workflow (check name: "pytest and coverage / pytest") to pass
#   before merging.
